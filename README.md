# to-do-list
A to do list built with JQuery, Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

This To Do list is an application to input daily tasks and mark out the ones that are already completed. You can edit the tasks and remove them easily.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

When creating a new input on the to do list, the program appends a new li element with the text, two buttons (Edit and Remove) and the corrsponding click listeners. 

Optimizations

In the future I will integrate it with a dynamic database to make it a practical tool for anyone to use.

Lessons Learned:
In this project I learned about event loops in JavaScript and the effect it has when adding listeners to elements that weren't on the original DOM.
